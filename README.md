= HeartBeepJs =

Constant interval condition-based audio beep for application status tracking (or more?)

Configure a constantly beeping sound that can be changed using your own conditions (e.g. errors, warning, critical decisions?)


Todos:
* Parameters on the match() function?
* Check if Repeater is better to use than setInterval
* Check if add_logger and add_repeater should be removed from deps
